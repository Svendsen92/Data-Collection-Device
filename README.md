# Environment Monitoring System

### *Objective*
The objective of the repository is twofold 1) To create a small formfactor data collection device, that gathers data about the environment (temperature, humidity, light intensity, Co2, etc). The device has to be easily configurable and able to run a database in which all device related and sensor data is stored. 2) To create a website from which mmultiple devices can be add and their data viewed. 

### *How to get it running*
The Library requires a few packages to be installed.
1. Always do this: sudo apt update & sudo apt upgrade
2. Used for interacting with the temperature & humidity sensor: sudo pip install Adafruit-DHT
3. Used for interaction with mySQL database: sudo pip install mysql-connector-python
4. Used to install mariaDB on linux: [tutorial link](https://raspberrytips.com/install-mariadb-raspberry-pi/)

Now the libraries & programs needed should be ready.
